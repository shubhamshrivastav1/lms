## **Backend Roadmap (In Development)** 🔧

### 🔌 Planned API Endpoints

| **Endpoint**       | **Method** | **Purpose**               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `/api/courses`     | GET        | Fetch all courses         |
| `/api/courses/:id` | GET        | Get single course details |
| `/api/enroll`      | POST       | Handle Stripe payments    |
| `/api/progress`    | PATCH      | Update student progress   |

### 🗂️ Database Models (MongoDB Example)

```javascript
const Course = new Schema({
  title: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  chapters: [
    {
      title: String,
      videos: [String] // Cloudinary URLs
    }
  ]
});
```

### 🛠️ Planned Backend Stack

* **Node.js** + **Express**
* **MongoDB** (with Mongoose ODM)
* **Stripe API** for payments
* **JWT** for user authentication
